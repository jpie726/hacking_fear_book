# Debugging/Fixing Habit Loops
This chapter is where my computer skills start to come in handy. In order to build secure web applications you need to know a little about the dark arts of hacking. Using similar techniques I have used to disrupt computer loops and alter a system's behavior I have had success applying them to my athletes to disrupt unwanted habit loops and alter their unwanted behavior routines to benifit the athelete.

Here I outline 4 tequniques I have developed over the years to help you get your athelete through their fear issues:

* Disruption
* Association
* Repition
* Empowerment

Lets get into it.

###Disruption:
When a computer system expects a number and you put in letters this is a form of disruption. The same can be applied to an athlete's habit loop to bypass the cue that triggers the unwanted behavior routine preventing the athelete from completing their skills.


####Drill Progression Ques:
For example let's say the athlete is afraid of _Skill C_ and they know that during practice the coach has them start with _Skill A_, then _Skill B_, then _Skill C_. _Skill A_ followed by _Skill B_ becomes the cue to trigger the unwanted behavior. Try mixing it up a little, surprise them. Switch back to basics when they don't expect it. 

Often times I am asked by other coaches to help their athletes get through their fear issues. The coach will tell the athlete "Go work with Matt on your giants". The athlete will tense up expecting me to toss them right up on the bar. Instead I will then spend the next 20 minutes doing shaping drills, back extension rolls, and other floor drills. Once the athlete is comfortable and I am happy with their basics we will eventually make our way to the real bar. 

Again they tense up in anticipation of the impending giant. I will then have them do tap swings, perhaps some casts,and a hand full of clear hip circles focusing on grip flip until they big scary giant swing is again no longer in the front of their mind. Finally we work our way to the point where the athlete's mental defenses twards the skill are down. Now it is time to start thinking about working that big end skill. 

Before you do I want to review some other points with you. 

####Verbal Ques:
If they are afraid of giants don't call them 'giants'. I am not saying lie to them, but 'a rose by any other name...'. Break down the skill into its components: "We are going to do a cast handstand drop into a long hang pullover miss your hips and then finish like a back extension roll". If you are a gymnastics person then you know I pretty much described a giant in wonky terms. I would never tell a kid that whole thing but I would happily start out with a baby giant then tell the child just to focus on two key pieces like the "hollow fall" and "finishing like a back extension roll to handstand".

Dodge the easily avoidable verbal cues that trigger the defense behavioral routine. Even once the athlete throws one or two of them because they didn't realize what they were doing exactly I am hesitant to use the word because it might cause the defensive behavioral routine to kick back in. Just be patient and keep it simple.


####Environment Ques:
Another advantage of coaching at camp is that camp is a brand new enviroment. Here the athlete has few if any preexisting ques. A vault table is a vault table and a beam is a beam. Some ques will persist but lets look at all of the other aspects of the environment that is different:

* The series of events that make up a daily practice
* The coaching staff and the techniques they use
* The facility
* The group dynamics are altered by the other children that are not on your team
* Litterally the bed they wake up in and the food they eat for breakfast

All of this new stimuli might be enough to overwhelm to forget their fear or the complete change of environment might just be different enough the ques don't get triggered in quite the same way.  Either way it's a huge advantage I have here at camp to overcome unwanted behavioral routines.

You can use similar approaches by tweaking variables in the atheletes enviroment. 

* You could go to a camp or you could go to a friendly gym. 
* You might not need to change the entire environment, try doing your drills in a different part of the gym or try brining the athlete in at a different time of day. 
* Change your groupings, or switch coaches. 

Mix it up and keep them guessing a little. This will help you disrupt the unwanted habit loop.


###Association:
Once you have successfully disrupted the unwanted habit loop it is time to start building the habit loops you want your athlete to have. This is easier said then done. 

Before you start digging back in and training your athlete to perform those incredibly precise actions you may want to be a little proactive in order to silence the metaphorical **that voice in the back of their head**.  I am talking about when you start making some progress with your athlete and all of the sudden that little voice in the back of their head kicks in and starts screaming "Don't do it!". Then they start freezing up and the unwanted habit loop comes back. There is no visual que, no haptic(feel) cue, just the athletes mind screaming "don't do it". 

####First a little story about me:
All through school I had trouble focusing on what the teacher was saying. My mother refused to medicate me and I sincerely thank her for it now. I struggled until when I was a sophmore in highschool when I had a revelation:
 
I found in history and english I could draw during a lecture and absorb what the teacher was saying. 

Interestingly enough this did not work in math. It also didn't work in classes where I needed to engage visually but it sure made listening to lectures easier. 

To this day I absorb audio books with ease. I have expanded the activities I can engage in while absorbing audible(non numeric) information to the following:

* Computer programming
* Drawing
* Working out(assuming it is repetitive cardio or a lifting routine I am familiar with)

Interestingly enough when I tried other activities while listening to audible information I was almost completely unable process it. Activities such as:

* Having a conversation
* Reading pretty much anything
* Writing pretty much anything

Knowing all of this I had to ask the question "Why did performing some activities allow me to focus and perform better while others completely conflicted? Here is my explanation:

####Dueling Hemispheres:
__Before I get into this next little bit I want to restating my disclaimer: **I do not have a PHD in neuroscience**. This a theoretical explanation based on the reading I have done as a hobbyist on findings by people with fancy degrees. Even they don't all agree. As a matter of fact they seem to take great joy in poking holes in each others theories as I am sure they will with this one. I strongly suggest you use the tools available to you to do your own research when you get a chance. I mean don't go dissecting anyones brain or anything but read up.__

One potential explanation is lateralization of brain functions between the two cerebral hemispheres. This is an area still under strong research but bare with me for a moment while we hypothesize. What if occupying one section of the brain with a simple task allowed the other to operate without interruption? Occupying the portion of my brain used to process visual information or repetitive physical actions seems to free another section to absorb.

This lead me to wonder if the opposite was true:

**If I occupied the side that processed that audible information, that 'voice in the back of my head' then would that free the portion of the brain that is used to perform predetermined physical routines?**

After years of research, discussion and testing different applications of this theory in pratice with various atheletes I have found some techniques that have worked well for me.

##Positive Association/My mother's cooking:
There is another way association can be used to silence **the voice in the back of their head**. 

Back in 2013 a coach came to me with an athlete that had a "mental block"(we will discuss this verbage later). The coach sent her athlete to me saying "Matt is going to work with you on SKILL X". If you remember earlier the mention of the skill's name can be a verbal cue to trigger the defensive habit loops that prevent the athlete from performing the skill. This was indeed one of those times. The athlete was afraid to even touch the apparatus. I observed this right away. We took a step back and I started applying my disruption techniques I talked about earlier. We started with basic floor drills that the athlete would have difficulty objecting to. 

As we progressed I started to ask a series of seemingly unrelated questions aimed at creating a simple dialog with the athlete. 

Questions like "What is your favorite subject in school?". On a side note I do have a series of questions are actually aimed at figuring out the athlete's learning style but I will save that topic for another book.

Me:"What did you have for breakfast?"
The Athlete: "Pancakes"
Me: "Nice, I am not a fan of the pancakes here at camp."
The Athlete: "Me neither"
Me: "I had eggs with hot sauce on them"
The Athlete: "Yuck!?!"
Me: "Have you tried it?"
The Athlete: "No!"
Me: "You should try it"
The Athlete: "..."
Me: "Breakfast is my favorite meal. Do you know why?"
The Athlete: "Why?"
Me: "When I was a kid my mom was raising me and my brother and working full time but she always woke up before the crack of dawn to cook a warm breakfast for us. I never went to school without a warm breakfast."
The Athlete: "You're lucky"
Me: "I know. Tell me about your mom"

The athlete and I then proceeded to have a long conversation about her mom, her dog, her grandma, etc; All positive things in her life. As we talked I was walking her closer and closer to the big skill by progressing through seemingly random drills. All the while I never mentioned the name of the big skill; the verbal cue which would trigger the unwanted behavior routine. 

We eventually made our way to the high bar and quickly progressed from **baby giants** to **baby giants miss your hips** then finally to **baby giant miss your hips finish like a back extension roll to handstand**(A giant). She completed this big scary skill wiht ease several times before I looked over and saw the athlete's speechless coach.

###How it worked:
During this exercise I started out using our conversation in between drills to assist in the **disruption** process. After a little while I changed gears to steer the conversation between the athlete and myself towards positive things; things she was comfortable with: 

* Her Mom
* Her Grandma
* Her Dog

Theoretically this prevented interuption of the section of her brain that was controlling the physical actions by the part of her brain that previously screamed scary/negative thinking because that section was occupied with positive mom/dog/grandma thoughts.

Basically I associated positive thoughts with the environment, the skills, and perhaps even myself. This made the athlete more comfortable and able to complete the skill without the fear popping back up.


By the way the story about my mom is true. I can't thank her enough for that.


####Coaches Body Language:
When coaching an athlete our verbal conversation is just one small piece of the interaction. The tone of our voice, our facial expressions and our non-verbal body language can convey unintentional messages. Even young athletes pick up on an astounding amount of non-verbal cues. Remember this when trying to communicate anything to your athletes.

A lot of our body language is subconscious, as in we do not mean to communicate it. It just happens naturally. Whatever thoughts are in our mind get conveyed via our body. 

So trick yourself if you have to. Go out into the gym before practice and get your head on strait. Do the same things you would have your athlete do:

* Visualize yourself coaching them through the breakthrough
* Repeat to yourself "She/He's got this!"

It's tough to coach an athlete through a skill you yourself do not believe them capable of.


####Putting words to it:
In 2013 I had the good fortune to attend a coaching clinic by an olympian on the topic of the mental side of gymnastics(I hope in future drafts of this book she will give me permission to use her name). It was an amazing clinic that opened my eyes to some great philosophies and techniques for dealing with fear. One of the things that really resonated with me was that she created audible cues to go along with her beam and floor routines. 

She broke down and isolated each part of the beam or floor routine. Then added audible cues the athelete would repeat to themselves in the exact same sequence every time. When put together it became a routine.

######Hypothisis - Floor vs Beam Ques:
Perhaps the presence of audible cues in the form of the music played along with a floor routine and the absence of any audible cues on beam can explain why you see so much more fear issues on the beam then floor.

Observing a famous choreographer/coach use music to set the pace of his beam complex and watching the atheletes carry out the complex with out insident leads me to belive this theory might hold some water. 

#####Applying it:
Try it in your gym. For each skill in a particular series of skills leading up to or including the big bad skill make up simple verbal cues that can be strung together in a sequence that the athelete can use to assist their physical actions. 

Here is an example that I successfully used recently to help a girl through her giant, giant, fly aways on bars:

* First Giant - "Toes up"
* Second Giant - "Toes Up"
* Fall into the fly away - "Pike Down"
* Fly away - "That was easy"

Additionally for comedic effect in an effort to get the athlete to drop their defensive mechanisms I would literally sing the words aloud as the athlete did the skills(I am not a good singer). She went on the first turn after we applied this method and with in 5 turns was doing it herself without needing the words repeated aloud.

######Single Skills/Series:
In the above example you can see that we used this technique for just a small series of skills at the end of a bar routine. I have also had success using it in a single beam series pass leading up to the acro series. If you are going to do this I suggest not just creating an audio cue for the big frightening skill but also a couple of steps ahead. Making the cue that starts the behavioral routine a couple of steps ahead of the danger area will increase the chance the trained habit loop triggers before the unwanted habit loop has a chance to kick in. 

######Full Routines:
Of course this technique can be applied to entire routines. It just depends on the athlete's ability to keep it all in their head. 

One thing you may want to try is training your beam complex to music or even your entire beam routines. While training the routines you will have to play the song on repeat ad nauseum but how is that different from floor anyway? Once they get it down ideally they should be able to play the song in their head while their body performs the actions.








##Repetition:
We started out by **disrupting** the unwanted habit loop. Then we got their mind relaxed and positive with **association**. Now it is time to start building the new habit loops with **repetition**. 
How do we teach our athletes any skill? Repetition after repetition after repetition until it's second nature. 


Isn't that how we as coaches teach anything? Yes but what I am focused on here is the tiny details:

* What happens between skills and drills? 
* What happens before you start practice on the event? 
* How do they chalk up? 

The tiniest details can make a big difference in the athlete's behavior.

###Michael Phelps:
Michael Phelps, the olympic swimmer with 22 gold medals, was known to hold to an extremely precise daily and pre-race routine. This is not by accident. He and his coaches developed these routines over time to cue him up for his amazing performances during his races. This included the smallest detail such as which ear his ear bud was in and which playlists he listened to.


For a small sample of his rotine check out [This article on LiveStrong.com](http://www.livestrong.com/article/1002130-michael-phelps-before-race/). For a more indepth look into his routines check out the book [The Power of Habit. Why we do what we do and how to change](http://amzn.to/1CHa2XW).

###John Wooden:
John Wooden is widely renowned as one of the best collegiate basketball coaches of all time if not one of the greatest coaches of any sport. In this [News Week article](http://www.newsweek.com/john-wooden-first-how-put-your-socks-167942) they discuss one of his tequnkiques that I find amazing. 

During the players first practice he would spend an incredible amount of time focused on the tiniest details. He would literally walk his athletes through how to lace up their shoes.

Imagine if we trained these tiny details in our respective sports? What if in gymnastics during the first practice after moving athletes up from a lower level we stopped and took the time to review the exact process of gripping up and chalking up for bars? By teaching them the right way you could decrease the 10 minutes teenagers seem to waste gripping up and chalk talk inbetween turns.

###Back to our earlier example:
Remember the earlier association example? I told you I broke down the young athelete's drills to basics right? I also used repetition to enforce certain habit loops I wanted to mentally condition into her as we progressed back toward the high bar and the big skill.

Once we moved past the basic floor exercises I tried to do each drill three times before letting her down to chalk. We then repeate that cycle three times before progressing onto the next drill. 

* 3 cast handstands then chalk then repeated three times
* 3 clearhips to horizontal then chalk the repeat three times
* 3 sets of 3 tap swings with good shape

This created a simple pattern for us to follow.  

Additionally I would try and use the same verbal, visual, and kinesthetic cues as I coached so as not to disrupt the pattern. I started her on floor by testing her shape.  I would make her hold a handstand and gently try and push her out of that shape while telling her not to let me. I did this with all of the basic shapes required to do a giant. This forced her to squeeze the muscle groups required to hold the shape. 

As we progressed I would test certain parts of her shape before every turn when she got ready to perform the drill. This enforced squeezing that muscle group during the skill into the behavior loop I was teaching her.

Similar verbal cues were used each time she got up to do the skill and got down to chalk.

The big reason for all of this was that when it came time to do _the big scary skill_ absolutely nothing had changed. Same verbal ques, same kinesthetic cues, no variation beyond "finishing like a back extension roll" which is something the athlete had been doing since she was a level 4 and was comfortable with. Since I had not introduced even a single new variable there was no uncertainty in her mind both subconscious and conscious. No uncertainty their fore no fear. 

So she got up and performed the repetitions we had been practicing and sure enough popped that giant strait up to handstand. Of course we did two more with the exact same ques before I let her down to chalk. 

Because it was not part of the routine we had built I never even mentioned the name of the big scary skill until we had done our third set of three and gone over to talk to her coach. The athlete was actually a little surprised that she was in fact doing giants when we started to talk about it.





###Decision Fatigue:
In this [Fast Company](http://www.fastcompany.com/3026265/work-smart/always-wear-the-same-suit-obamas-presidential-productivity-secrets) article they talk about how the President of America always wears the same suit. He applys this to a lot of day to day decisions that most of us as adults make like what he eats for breakfast. Why is this? The answer:

**He doesn't want to waste his decision making power.**

There have been many studies that show we have limited willpower and that each decision you make exhausts your mental faculties a little bit until your decision making abilities are shot and you start making bad decisions. It's called **Decision Fatigue**.

He negates these effects by creating a daily routine that dictates his decisions for him.
Repeating a like Michael Phelps' routine over and over for years took makes it so its second nature. Like brushing your teeth. No need to waste mental energy making decisions.

Allowing your athlete to diverge from their daily routine in the gym forces them to think and make decisions. This can be a good thing during the **disruption** stage but not great during the **repetition** phase. Each new decision they have to make potentially depletes their mental will power to push himself forward and make the tough decisions such as 'to go' or 'not to go'.







##Empowerment:
One of the last tools I have in my bag of tricks is empowerment. This means showing the athlete how much they actually have control over. Earlier we talked about how uncertainty in the athlete's mind causes fear. Showing the athelete that they control the outcome of the skill by chosing their actions removes uncertanty and puts the power in their hands. Remember remove uncertanty then ou remove fear.

###Take the mystery out of it by focus on what they can control:(POSSIBLY MOVE TO PREVIOUS CHAPTER)
Remember the child that was afraid of the monster under the bed in our earlier example? We removed some uncertainty from their mind by showing them there is no monster under the bed. What if we put some control into their hands by leaving them a flashlight on their night stand so that any time they felt that mean old monster might be under the bed they could check for themselves. 

Often times the control is already there they just don't realize it. In the end it's not you the coach/parent that controls the athlete's body. It's all them, the athelete. 

###Example:
Let's say little Susie saw another athlete ping off the bar and no one explained what caused the ping. All she knows is the girl casted up to do a giant(a big scary skill) and something went bad. What caused it is _uncertain_ in her mind. Maybe the athlete that pinged had the wrong stuff for breakfast. It could have been a bad spot by the coach. It could have been the bar she was swinging on. It could have been that the skill itself is a death trap. Or even potentially voodoo. The athlete could imagine up any amount of ridiculous reasons the skill went wrong but will probably end up blaming the skill. 

It is your responsibility as a coach to:

1. Help the athlete understand what went wrong - The athlete that pinged arched way to early
2. Show them what they can control to make it go right - 'If you squeeze the muscles in your belly while you drop past the low bar you will not ping'

Notice that statement was an empowering statement. Lets break it down:

* 'If you' - _you_(the athlete) are in control
* 'squeeze the muscles in your belly' - by performing a really simple set of actions that you have been doing since the first day you set foot in the gym
* 'while you drop past the low bar' - The duration of the above squeezing is a simple specific cue (visual and haptic)
* 'you will not ping' -  the result will be awesome and everyone will be happy and so on.

Now they all of the sudden have control of the outcome. They no longer can attribute the outcome to unknown causes such as voodoo or which side of the bed they woke up on. It is really simple and keeps them really focused on the parts of the skill that make a difference.

###Applying it:
I suggest breaking down big skills into smaller pieces that the athlete can focus on. Peaces they are comfortable with.

#####Start with the scary part:
Start witht he drop into the giant or the leaning back on the back handspring on beam. What part of that does the athelete control that can make for a better outcome of the skill?


#####Start at the begining:
If there is no scary part start at the beginning. ---//Losing steam here
Lets say were correcting a vault and we see a slow run and an open early tuck off the table where should we start? With the tuck at the end? Or the slow run? You might be able to squeeze a couple more degrees of rotation out of the flip by tucking tighter but doubling their run speed will have a lot bigger effect on the end skill.

#####Try communicating in que, routine reward format:
Here is a correction I used recently for an athelete afraid of a round off on beam: 
_"When starting your round off on beam start to kick your back leg up over before reaching for the beam or turning your hips then the skill will turn over quicker and easier"_

Lets break it down:

1. Que: "When starting your round off on beam..."
2. Routine: "... start to kick your back leg up over before reaching for the beam or turning your hips..."
3. Reward: "...then the skill will turn over quicker and easier"

#####Focus on specific muscles:
One of the worst corrections I hear constantly is "Go faster or go higher". What muscle group do you need to fire to 'go faster'? Answer that question and communicate that answer to the athelete.

For the above round off example have them kick their back leg high by actually fire their glutes and hamstrings. This should reenforce these muscles fireing during their behavioral routine.

####Blinders:
Have you ever seen a horse and buggy? Most of the time the horse has some weird head gear on that shields their peripheral vision. This basically blinds them to anything that is not in front of them. This is so that the horse doesn't get spooked or distracted by things that are outside of the area the driver wants them focused on.

Figuring out what to focus on is only half the battle. Keeping your atheles focused on those actions is key. We all have a limited amount of mental processing power. We can only focus on so many things at a time. The last thing you need are distractions poping up to pull their focus away from the important things.  Help your athletes keep focused on the variables in their control by creating blinders of your own.

#####Environment Blinders:
This one is obvious but important all the same. Make sure there are no distractions in the environment. No changing variables that are not in your athletes or at least your control. For example birthday parties in the gym with little ones running around create a whole new level of visual and audible distractions. Not to mention the potential child running through the bottom of the bar as your athlete cast up for a big skill.

The human element in the enviroment counts too. Parents, Sibblings, and Teammates all can be distractions too. 

Cheering on the athlete in some cases might be a distraction; not for everyone but for some. 

Just remember to be mindful of the potential distraction in the environment and try and figure out ways to eliminate them from your athlete's focus.

#####Spotting Blinders:
"Don't worry about what I as a coach am doing, just focus on the skill". If the athlete is thinking about what you are doing, specifically if you are going to spot or not, then they are not fully focused on the correction. They need to trust you, but more importantly they need to trust themselves and that they can control the outcome by performing the specific actions you have instructed them to do. If they are focused on you then you quickly become a crutch. 

When this happens take a couple of steps back and do drills that do not depend on your spot that will help the athlete feel the correction in action and their ability to control the outcome of the drill based on their actions. Yes this is repetitive and may seem like back peddling but it is important they feel they have control and that there is no uncertainty when performing the action without a spot.

#####Correction Blinders:
When I tell an athlete "I want you to focus on squeezing your belly muscles as you drop into the giant" this is obviously NOT the only thing I want them to do in the skill. I want them to cast, tap at the bottom, keep their arms straight, etc. But if I tell them that everytime when I have already observed that those corrections are muscle memory then I am flooding them with input and distractions. To many things to focus on or correct can easily inhibit your athlete's ability to make even one simple correction.

I suggest finding the biggest barrier or in some cases the first issues in a string of many and focus on it until it is 100% muscle memory. Again this can take a long time but is worth it in the end.



###Verbage:
A lot of times I tell the athletes to "Own it" right before a pass. Let's say for example it is a tumbling pass: I typically indicate that there are no obstacles between them and their destination. I also point out the absurdity of imagining that I would be quick enough to remove a section of the floor or place an obstacle in their way. This demonstrates that there are no changing variables in the environment that would affect the outcome of the pass. The only changing variables are the actions they take and they need to remember that the actions they take are under their control.

"Own the round off, own the handspring, own the back tuck at the end. They are all yours. You are in control of it"
