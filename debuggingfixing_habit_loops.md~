# Debugging/Fixing Habit Loops
This chapter is where my computer skills start to come in handy. You see in order to build secure web applications you need to know a little about the dark arts of hacking. Using similar techniques I have used to disrupt computer loops and alter a systems behavior I have had success appling them to my atheletes to disrupt unwanted habit loops and alter their unwanted behavior routines.

###Disruption:
When a system expects a number and you put in letters this is a form of disruption. The same can be applied to an atheletes habit loop to by pass the que that triggers the behavior that prevents them from completing their skills.



####Progression Ques(TODO: Find a better name):
For example lets say the athelete is afraid of skill c and they know that during pratice the coach has them start with skill A, then skill B, then skill C. Skill A followed by Skill B becomes the que to trigger the unwanted behavior. Try mixing it up a little, supprise them. Switch back to basics when they don't expect it. 

Often times I am asked by other coaches to help their atheletes get through their fear issues. The coach will tell the athelete "Go work with Matt on your giants" and the athelete will tense up expecting me to toss them right up on the bar. I will then spend the next 20 minutes doing shaping drills, backextension rolls, and floor drills. Once the athelete is comfortable and I am happy with their basics we will eventually make our way to the real bar. Again they tense up in anticipation of the impending giant. I will then have them do tap swings, perhaps some casts, a hand full of clear hip circles focusing on grip flip until they big scary giant swing is back of mind. Finally we work our way to the point where the athelete's defenses are down and they no longer have their defense up. Now it is time to start thinking about working that big end skill, before you do I want to review some other points with you. 

####Verbal Ques:
If they are afraid of giants dont call them 'giants'. I am not saying lie to them, but 'a rose by any other name'. Like I have been saying all along, break down the skill into its components. "Were going to do a cast handstand drop into a long hang pullover miss your hips and then finish like a back extension roll". If you are a gymnastics person then you know I pretty much described a giant in lessor terms. I would never tell a kid that whole thing but I would happily start out with a baby giant then tell the child just to focus on two key peaces like the "hollow fall" and "finishing like a backextension roll to handstand".

If you can dodge the easily avoidable verbal ques that trigger the defense mechnisim. Even once the athelete throws one or two of them because they didn't realize what they were doing exactly I am hesitant to use the word for fear that it might cause the defensive behavorial routine to kick back in. Just be patient and keep it simple.


####Enviroment Ques:
Another advantage of being a camp coach is that it is a brand new enviroment that the athelete has few if any preexising ques. I mean a vault table is a vault table and a beam is a beam. Some ques will presist but lets look at all of the other aspects of the enviroment that is different:
* The series of events that make up a daily pratice
* The coaching staff and the tequniques they use
* The facility
* The group dynamics are altered by the other children that are not on your team

All of this new stimuli might be enough to overwhelm them enough to forget their fear or the complete change of enviroment might just be different enough the ques don't get triggered in quite the same way.  Eather way its a huge advantage I have hear at camp to overcome unwanted behavioral routines.

You can use similar approches by tweaking similar variables. You could go to a camp or you could go to a friendly gym. You might not need to change the entire enviroment, try doing your drills in a different part of the gym or try brining the athelete in at a different time of day. Change your groupings, or switch coaches. Mix it up and keep them guessing a little. This will help you disrupt the unwanted habit loop.

#####Coaches Body Language can be an inhibitor
//Perhaps move this to that last chapter



###Association:
Once you have successfully disrupted the unwanted habit loop it is time to start building the habit loops you want your athelete to have. This is easier said then done. 

Before you start digging back in and training your athelete to perform those increadibly percise actions you may want to be a little proactive in order to silence that voice in the back of their head. What do I mean by 'voice in the back of their head'? I am talking about when you start making some progress with your athelete and all of the suddon that little voice in the back of their head kicks in and starts screaming "Don't do it!" then they start freezing up and the unwanted habit loop comes back. That is what I mean by 'voice in the back of their head'. There is no visual que, no haptic(feel) que, just the atheletes mind screaming "don't do it". Lets examine the potential causes of this first.


####Random Backstory(//TODO: Better Title)
All through school I had trouble focusing on what the teacher was saying. My mother refused to medicate me and I sincerly thank her for it now. At time I strugled until when I was a sophmore in highschool I had a revolation. I found in history and english I could doodle and absorb what the teacher was saying. Interestingly enough this did not work in math. It also didn't work in classes where I needed to engage visually but it sure made listening to lectures easier. 

To this day I absorb audio books at a remakable pace. I have expanded the activities I can engage in while absorbing audible(non numeric) information to the following:
* Computer programming
* Drawing
* Working out(assuming it is repitive cardio or a lifting routine I am familar with)

Interestingly enough when I tried other activities while listening to audible information I was almost completely unable process it. Activities such as:
* Having a conversation
* Reading pretty much anything
* Writing pretty much anything

Knowing all of this I had to ask the question "Why did performing some activities allow to focus and perform better while others completely conflicted? Here is my explination:

####Dueling Hemispheres:
__Before I get into this next little bit I want to disclaimer this by restating the fact that I do **not have a PHD in neuro science**. This a theoretical explination based on the reading I have done as a hobbyiest on findings by people with those fancy degrees. Even they don't all agree. As a matter of fact they seem to take great joy in poking holes in each others theories as I am sure they will with this one. I strongly suggest you use the tools available to you to do your own research when you get a chance. I mean don't go disecting anyones brain or anything but read up. In the mean time here is a potential explination for how the association effect works.__

One potential explination is lateralization of brain functions between the two cerebral hemispheres. This is an area still under strong research but bare with me for a moment while we hypothisize. What if occupying one section of the brain with a simple task allowed the other to opporate with out inturuption? Occupying the portion of my brain used to process visual information or repetitive physical actions seems to free the other side to absorb.

This lead me to wonder if the opposite was true. If I occupied the side that processed that audible information, that 'voice in the back of my head' then would that free the portion of the brain that is used to preform predetermined pyhsical routines?

//TODO: ???? ADD 12 BRAIN RULES SMELL ASSOCIATION???


####Putting words to it:
In 2013 I had the good fortune to attend a coaching clinic by an olympian on the topic of the mental side of gymnastics(I hope in future drafts of this book she will give me permission to use her name). It was an amazing clinic that opened my eyes to some great phylosophies and tequniques for dealing with fear. One of the things that really resinated with me was that she created audible ques to go along with her beam and floor routines. 

She broke down and isolated each part of the routine. Then added audible ques that she would repeate to herself in the exact same sequence everytime. When put together it became her routine.

I, not primarily being an audibal learner, had not thought of putting words to the skills I trained nor the skills of the atheletes I was training.

Perhaps the presence of audible ques in the form of the music played along with a floor routine and the absence of any audible ques on beam can explain why you see so much more balking the beam then floor.

Observing a famous coriographier/coach use music to set the pace of his beam complex somewhat confirmed this theory. 
#####Applying it:
Try it in your gym. For each skill in a particular series of skills leading up to or including the big bad skill make up simple verbal ques that can be strung together in a sequence that the athelete can use to assist their phyiscal actions. 

Here is an example that I successfully used last week to help a girl through her giant, giant, fly aways on bars:

* First Giant - "Toes up"
* Second Giant - "Toes Up"
* Fall into the fly away - "Pike Down"
* Fly away - "That was easy"

Additionally in an effort to get the athelete to drop their defensive mechnisims I would litterally sing the words aloud as the athelete did the skills for comedic effect. She went on the first turn after we applied this method and with in 5 turns was doing it herself without needing the words repeated aloud.

######Single Skills/Series:
In the above example you can see that we used this tequnique for just a small series of skills at the end of a bar routine. I have also had success using it in a single beam series pass leading up to the acro series. If you are going to do this I suggest not just creating an audio que for the big frightning skill but also a couple of steps a head. Making the que that starts the behavioral routine a couple of steps ahead of the danger area will increase the chance the trained habit loop triggers and not the unwanted habit loop. 

######Full Routines:
Of course this can tequnique can be applied to entire routines, that just depends on the atheletes ability to keep it all in their head. 

One thing you may want to try is training your beam complex to music or even your entire beam routines. While training the routines you will have to play the song on repeat adnausium but how is that different from floor anyway? Once they get it down ideally they should be able to play the song in their head while their body performs the actions.



##Positive Association/My mothers cooking:
There is another way associatin can be used to silence 'the voice in the back of their head'. 

Back in 2013 a coach came to me with an athelete with a "mental block". The coach sent her athelete to me saying "Matt is going to work with you on SKILL X". If you remember earlier the mention of the skills name can be a verbal que to trigger the defensive habit loops that keep the athelete from performing the skill. This was indeed one of those times. This athelete was afraid to even touch the apperatious. I spotted this right away. I took a step back and started using my disruption tequniques I talked about earlier and started with basic floor drills that the athelete would have dificulty objecting to. 

As we progressed I started to ask a series of seemingly unrelated questions aimed at creating a simple dialog with the athelete. 

"What is your favorite subject in school?" etc. I have a series of quesitons are actually aimed at figuring out the athelete's learning style but I will save that topic for anther book.

Me:"What did you have for breakfast?"
The Athelete: "Pancakes"
Me: "Nice, I am not a fan of the pancakes here."
The Athelete: "Me neither"
Me: "I had eggs with hot sause on them"
The Athelete: "Yuck!?!"
Me: "Have you tried it?"
The Athelete: "No!"
Me: "You should try it"
The Athelete: "..."
Me: "Breakfast is my favorite meal. Do you know why?"
The Athelete: "Why?"
Me: "When I was a kid my mom was raising me and my brother along and working full time but she always woke up before the crack of dawn to cook a warm breakfast for me and my brother"
The Athelete: "Your lucky"
Me: "I know. Tell me about your mom"

The athelete and I then proceeded to have a long conversation about her mom, her dog, her grandma, etc. As we talked I was walking closer and closer to the big skill by progressing through seemingly random drills. All the while I never mentioned the name of the big skill triggering which would trigger verbal que that causes the unwanted behavior routine. 

We eventally made our way to the high bar and quickly progressed from **baby giants** to **baby giants miss your hips** then finally to **baby giant miss your hips finish like a back extension roll to handstand**(A giant). The athelete's coach was speachless.

###How it worked:
During this exercise I started out using out conversation inbetween drills to assist in the **disruption** process. After a little while I changed gears to use our conversation to steer the conversation between the athelete and myself twards positive things; things she was comportable with: 

* Her Mom
* Her Grandma
* Her Dog

Theoretically this kept part of her subconches brain focused on those good memories ensuring her thoughts did not float back twards scary/negative thinking while the section of her brain that was controling the physical actions required to complete my drills was not inturupted. 

Basically I associated positive thoughts with the enviroment, the skills, and perhaps even myself. This made the athelete more comphortable and able to complete the skill without the fear popping back up.


NOTE: The story about my mom is true by the way. I can't thank here enough for that.


###Coaches Body Language:
When coaching an athelete our verbal conversation is just one small peace of the conversation. The tone of our voice, our facial expressions and our non-verbal body language can convay unintentional messages. Even young atheletes pick up on an astounding amount of non-verbal ques. Remember this when trying to communicate anything to your atheletes.

A lot of our body language is sub-conchis, as in we do not mean to communicate it. It just happens naturally. Whatever thoughts are in our mind get convayed via our body. 

So trick yourself if you have to. Go out into the gym before pratice and get your head on strait. Do the same things you would have your athelete do:

* Visualize yourself coaching them through the breakthrough
* Repeat to yourself "She/He's got this!"
* Etc

It's tough to coach an athelete through a skill you yourself do not belive them capable of.



##Repition:
We started out by **disrupting** the unwanted habit loop. Then we got their mind relaxed and positive with **association**. Now it is time to start building the new habit loops with **repition**. 
How do we teach our atheletes any skill? Repition after repitition after repitition until its second nature. 
So I am assuming your no stranger to the repition teqnique. 

What I am focused on here is the tiny details. What happens between skills? What happens before you start pratice on the event? How do they chalk up? The tinyiest details can make a big difference in the athelete's behavior.



###The above example:
Remember the earlier association example? I told you I broke down her drills to basics right? I also used repition to enforce certain habit loops I wanted her to get in her head as we progressed back tward the high bar and the big skill.

Once we progressed past the non bar floor excercizes I tried to do everything in sets of three and three sets of each exercize. I used chalking to break up the bar exercizes into the sets.
* 3 cast handstands then chalk then repeaste three times
* 3 clearhips to horazontal then chalk the repeate three times
* 3 sets of 3 tap swings with good shape

Additionally I would try and use the same verbal, visual, and kinestetic ques. 

I started her on floor by testing her shape.  I would make her hold a handstand and gentally try and push her out of that shape while telling her not to let me. I did this with all of the basic shapes requried to do a giant. This forced her to squeeze the muscle groups required to hold the shape. As we progressed I would test certain parts of her shape before each turn when she got ready to perform the drill. This enforced squeezing that muscle group during the skill into the behavior loop I was teaching her.

Similar verbal ques were used each time she got up to do the skill and got down to chalk meanwhile inbetween we were having the formentioned **association** conversation.

The big reason for this was that when it came time to do _the big scary skill_ absolutly nothing had changed. Same verbal ques, same kinestetic ques, no variation beyond "finishing like a back extension roll" which is something the athelete had been doing since she was a level 4 and was comfortable. Since I had not introduced even a single new variable there was no uncertanty in her mind both sub conches and conches. No uncertanty, no fear. So she got up and performed the repitions we had been praticing and sure enough popped that giant strait up to hand stand. Of course we did two more with the exact same ques before I let her down to chalk. Because it was not part of the routine we had built I never even mentioned the name of the skill untill we had done our third set of three and gone over to talk to her coach. The athelete was actually a little supprised that she was infact doing giants when we started to talk about it.


###Michael Phelps:
Michael Phelps, the olympic swimmer with 22 gold metals, was known to hold to an extreamly percice daily and pre-race routine. This is not by acceident. He and his coaches developed these routines over time to que him up for his amazing performances during his races. The smallest detail such as which ear his ear bud was in and which playlists he listened to. 



For a small sample of his rotine check out [This article on LiveStrong.com](http://www.livestrong.com/article/1002130-michael-phelps-before-race/). For a more indepth look into his routines check out the book [The Power of Habit. Why we do what we do and how to change]().

###John Wooden:
//TODO: Research - Teaching his atheletes to lace up their shoes
John Wooden is widly renound as one of the best collegic basketball coaches of all time if not one of the greatest coaches of any sport. One of the things he did that I find amazing during the first pratice of the season he would spend an increadible amount of time focused on the tinest details. He would literally walk his atheletes through how to lace up their shoes.

Imagine if we trained these tiny details in our repsective sports? What if in gymnastics during the first pratice after moving atheletes up from a lower level we stopped and took the time to review the exact process of gripping up and chalking up for bars? This just might decrease chalk talk and the 10 minutes teenagers seem to waste gripping up.


###Willpower Vs Decisions:
//TODO: Insert  real link
In this [INSERT MAGAZINE NAME]() article they talk about how the President of America is NOT responsible for picking out his own clothes. He doesnt pick his breakfast either. There are a lot of day to day decisions that most of us as adults make that the president does not. Why is this? He doesn't want to waste his decision making power. 

There have been many studies that show we have limited will power and that each decision you make exhausts your mental faculties a little bit untill your decision making abilities are shot and you start making bad decisions.

Since you probablly do not have someone to pick out your tie and breakfast for you we have to rely on other tequniques such as creating a daily routine that dictates our decisions for us.
Repeating a like Michale Phelps' routine over and over for years took makes it so its second nature. Like brushing your teeth. No need to waste mental energy making decisions.

Allowing your athelete to diverge from their daily routine in the gym forces them to think and make decisions. This can be a good thing during the **disruption** stage but not great druring the **repition** phase. Each new decision they have to make potentially depleates their mental will power to push them self forward and make the tough decisions such as 'to go' or 'not to go'.


###Repition Conclusion:(NOT SURE HOW THIS IS GOING TO FIT IN)
Repition can help you both on a micro and macro scale to craft habit loops that will help your athelete perform at their best.



##Empowerment:

###Take the mystery out of it by focus on what they can control:(POSSIBLY MOVE TO PREVIOUS CHAPTER)
Remember the child that was afraid of the moster under the bed from our earlier example? We removed some uncertanty from their mind by showing them there is no moster under the bed. What if we took it a step forward by putting some control into their hands. What if we left them a flash light on their night stand so that any time they felt that mean old monster might be under the bed they could check for them selfs. 

Putting a little control in the atheletes hands is a powerful thing. Often times the control is already there they just don't realize it. I mean its not you the coach/parent that controls the atheletes body. It's all them. Once you show them how much they actually control.




//Skill peaces

//Mystery Errors
Giant tap



//Blinders for everything else

//Verbage "Own it" - Not just the skill but the floor and everything else.





####Verbage:
I talked about this in the previous section where I discussed the difference between diagnosing an athelete with a "mental block" versus telling them they are "over thinking" something. This is because it is difficult to figure out what action to take to remove a _mental block_ but it is easier to figure out what action to take to counter act "over thinking": Either don't think about the skill or think about the peaces of the skill instead of the big scary skill as a whole. The point is the verbage I use and encourage the atheletes to use is **actionable**.

Antoher phraseing I am adamte about correcting is the "I am bad at X" logic. If the athelete has it in their head that they are just "bad at bars" then why, why, why would they put any effort into bars. They are far more likely to focus on the events they feel they have a half a chance at. Again this is a **self fulfilling prophecy** and will encourage behavior that brings the "bad" statment to fruishion instead of creating actions against it. 

What happens when I rephrase it to "I need to improve X"? This leads to the next question "What can I do to improve X?". The answer of that question then leads the athelete to a solid list of actions that they can pratice until the habit loop you want them to learn is cemented into their brain. Isn't that alot easier?

Stating a single skill or routine "needs improvment" then proceeding to explain how to improve the skill works well but what about using it as a blanket labeling statment to describe the atheleate? As in "You need improvment on bars"? This is different but in my opion still fine as long as you can provide specific feedback on how they need to improve. "Susie needs to improve her bars and here are the actions she needs to take to improve them". Once she takes those actions she has improved her bars and the personal label is no longer really applicable. Even if the athelete still feels that their bars could use improvment as they progress and get older, is it the worst thing that they want to continue to improve even beyond the point that is considered good enough?

####Natural Talent:
Now I will be honest: it is not all sunshine and rainbows. It is true that not everyone is born with the same natural talent. Some people are naturals, and some have to work really hard to even make an inch of progress tward their goals. I am not encouraging you to decive all of your atheletes into beliving that. The highest level athelete I have ever had the pleasure of coaching was one of the least naturally talented.

It can be equally as dangerious to allow your more _naturally talented_ atheletes to belive that is will all come naturally to them. This can easily lead to the illusion that everything will come easy. Perhaps that first 80% of the way will but that last 20% will require more effort then your athelete may be prepaired to put in. You can never be sure when they will cease to be able to coast through on their natural talent and it becomes an up hill battle but when it does you want your atheletes prepaired to push through it.

What I would encourage is to have your atheletes focus on being "hard workers" not only that but "smart workers". I strong appreaciation for the fundementails .....
