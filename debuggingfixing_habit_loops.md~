# Debugging/Fixing Habit Loops



//Intro:
In order to build secure web apps I need to know a little about how to break them. So at times I have to put on my bad hacker hat and try to figure out how nefarious elements would try and take down one of my systems. 

Oddly enough I have found some interesting similarites......

* Creating New Behaviors
* * Disruption
* * * Enviroment Ques
* * * * Coaches Body Language can be an inhibitor
* * Association
* * * Mom/Eggs
* * * Dueling Hemospheres/Elise Ray
* * Repition
* * * Michael Phelps
* * * Vocal Ques
* * * Beam
* * * Communication Types - Audiable
* * Progressing to the goal
* * * Don't say the skill - Its a bad que
* * * Stay calm
* * * Little Flogal - Cast Long Hang Pullover to handstand

###Take the mystery out of it by focus on what they can control:
Remember the child that was afraid of the moster under the bed from our earlier example? We removed some uncertanty from their mind by showing them there is no moster under the bed. What if we took it a step forward by putting some control into their hands. What if we left them a flash light on their night stand so that any time they felt that mean old monster might be under the bed they could check for them selfs. 

Putting a little control in the atheletes hands is a powerful thing. Often times the control is already there they just don't realize it. I mean its not you the coach/parent that controls the atheletes body. It's all them. Once you show them how much they actually control


//Skill peaces

Giant tap



//Blinders for everything else

//Verbage "Own it" - Not just the skill but the floor and everything else.





####Verbage:
I talked about this in the previous section where I discussed the difference between diagnosing an athelete with a "mental block" versus telling them they are "over thinking" something. This is because it is difficult to figure out what action to take to remove a _mental block_ but it is easier to figure out what action to take to counter act "over thinking": Either don't think about the skill or think about the peaces of the skill instead of the big scary skill as a whole. The point is the verbage I use and encourage the atheletes to use is **actionable**.

Antoher phraseing I am adamte about correcting is the "I am bad at X" logic. If the athelete has it in their head that they are just "bad at bars" then why, why, why would they put any effort into bars. They are far more likely to focus on the events they feel they have a half a chance at. Again this is a **self fulfilling prophecy** and will encourage behavior that brings the "bad" statment to fruishion instead of creating actions against it. 

What happens when I rephrase it to "I need to improve X"? This leads to the next question "What can I do to improve X?". The answer of that question then leads the athelete to a solid list of actions that they can pratice until the habit loop you want them to learn is cemented into their brain. Isn't that alot easier?

Stating a single skill or routine "needs improvment" then proceeding to explain how to improve the skill works well but what about using it as a blanket labeling statment to describe the atheleate? As in "You need improvment on bars"? This is different but in my opion still fine as long as you can provide specific feedback on how they need to improve. "Susie needs to improve her bars and here are the actions she needs to take to improve them". Once she takes those actions she has improved her bars and the personal label is no longer really applicable. Even if the athelete still feels that their bars could use improvment as they progress and get older, is it the worst thing that they want to continue to improve even beyond the point that is considered good enough?

####Natural Talent:
Now I will be honest: it is not all sunshine and rainbows. It is true that not everyone is born with the same natural talent. Some people are naturals, and some have to work really hard to even make an inch of progress tward their goals. I am not encouraging you to decive all of your atheletes into beliving that. The highest level athelete I have ever had the pleasure of coaching was one of the least naturally talented.

It can be equally as dangerious to allow your more _naturally talented_ atheletes to belive that is will all come naturally to them. This can easily lead to the illusion that everything will come easy. Perhaps that first 80% of the way will but that last 20% will require more effort then your athelete may be prepaired to put in. You can never be sure when they will cease to be able to coast through on their natural talent and it becomes an up hill battle but when it does you want your atheletes prepaired to push through it.

What I would encourage is to have your atheletes focus on being "hard workers" not only that but "smart workers". I strong appreaciation for the fundementails .....
