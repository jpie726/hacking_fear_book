##Conclusion:
I hope you got as much out of reading this book as I did writing it. It was also secretly my hope while writing this that some of these concept in the book could be applied to life outside the gym as well.


Please feel free to send me any feedback(good or bad, I appreaciate both) you have to me via my website [HackingGymnastics.com](http://hackinggymnastics.com?utm_source=hacking_fear)

Good luck to you and your athletes in everything you do in your respective sports and in your lives.
