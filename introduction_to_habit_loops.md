# Introduction to Habit Loops



##Behavioral Routines:
In gymnastics we train our atheletes to complete routuines right? A complex set of percise actions designed by us, the coaches. 

The same can be said for Football, Baseball, Cheer Leading, Martial Arts, etc. Think about the exact order that all of the various muscles must fire in order to throw a spirial touchdown pass or to succussfully do a sweap that takes your oponent to the ground while grappling. All of these are tiny routines that we learn and tweak over time.

//...SOmething else...

If you have an athelete that has fear issues you probablly are sitting there screaming "But I never drilled that routine into them! How did it get there!". The routine is just part of the habit loop, there is a lot more to it then just that. 




##Habit Loops:
One of my favorite books on the topic of behavior is [The Power of Habit
Why we do what we do and how to change]()
By Charles Duhigg. In this book he discusses the concept of a habit loop. A habit loop is what makes up perform various behaviors. 





A habbit loop is similar to the **procedure** programming concept I mentioned earlier. 

The habit loop can be broken down into 3 parts:

* Que - The trigger that determines which habit fires off and when
* Routine - The exact set of actions that takes place once the brain has recognized the que
* Reward - The result of your actions that tahe brain precives. Each time this reward is realized it reenforces the habbit loop.
 
Each habit can be broken down this way:
####Example 1:
The most basic and well know expirement is [Pavlov's Dogs](http://www.simplypsychology.org/pavlov.html). This is a farily well know expirement where Ivan Pavlov conditions dogs to assoicate a bell ringing with dinner time. Over time the dogs would hear the bell and start to salivate in anticipation of dinner. Eventually the bell alone was enough to trigger the salivation. Lets break this down:

* Que: The Bell
* Routine: The brain tells the body to start to salivate
* Reward: The food, and the spike in blood sugar and other various rewards we get from ingesting foot

####Example 2:
As you can imagine there is both positive and negative behaviors. Here is a lession most of us learn as a kid sometime:

* Que: You see the pretty glow from something red hot
* Trigger: Curiousity dictates that you reach out and touch it
* Reward: Pain... lots of pain

So that pain you felt did not enforce the behavior but instead deture the behavior. Next time you see something glowing red the habit loop is a little different:

* Que: You see the pretty glow from something red hot
* Trigger: You run, hide, cry to mom
* Reward: No pain

####Example 3:
This last one might hit a little closer to home.

* Que:  My coach asks me to do giants
* Behavior: I cast over despite the fact I easily know how
* Reward: My coach focuses on my cast instead and I don't have to do the scary giants

####How long does it take to form a habit loop?
It depends on the complexity of the rutine, the sevarity of the reward, the frequency of the que. 

#####Complexity of Routine:
When coaching we try and enforce the mental routines through repition after repition. Due to the vast amount of muscles required to performe extreamly percise tasks it often takes a long time to enforce a behavior such as a vault or a beam series.

#####Sevarity of Reward:
Training fundimantal body shapes rarely have a large and/or imediate reward that a young athelete will see. This makes it less likely to stick. 

On the other hand a negative reward such as a painful fall can alter an athelete's behavior routine extreamly quickly.

#####Frequency of ques:
How frequently do you train a skill or make a correction is important. If you only do basic shaping once a month or less the behavior is less likely to be inforced. Similar if an athelete observes other atheletes or them selfs enduring painful rewards for their actions then they will most likely craft habit loops that avoid those actions.
