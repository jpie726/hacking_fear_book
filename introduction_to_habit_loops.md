#Behavioral Routines and Habit Loops:
In gymnastics we train our athletes to a complex set of precise actions designed by the coaches. The same can be said for other sports such as Swimming, Dance, Cheer and Track. 

Technically other sports such as Football, Baseball, and Soccer have similar routines except their routines are much smaller change more frequently based on the other players actions.

In gymnastics this is known as a 'routine'. For our purposes I would like to talk about behavioral routines. The behavioral routines I am talking about can encompass a full floor routine or just a single tumbling pass. Gripping up for bars is a technically even a routine. The behavioral routines I would like to talk about are any series of actions an individual has learned to perform in a sequence. These routines can be learned either intentionally or unintentionally.

Think about the exact order that all of the various muscles must fire to do a tumbling pass or throw a spiral touchdown pass. All of these are tiny routines that we learn and tweak over time.

###Your daily routine

You even have a daily routine. Here is my morning routine:

* Wake up at 5am
* Eat a granola bar and 1/2 a caffeine tablet
* Meditate/be greatful for 10 minutes
* Put my daily meals into my backpack
* Head to the gym
* Work out for 90 minutes
* Shower, brush teeth etc 
* Head into the office
* Write for 90 minutes
* Review my todo list and start working

Chances are it is not a routine that was coached or conditioned into you by a third party(unless your still a child or in the military). Some people's morning routines are carefully crafted and tweaked while others morning routines are just something they fell into over time. The point is not all behavioral routines are intentionally crafted.


###Gym routine:
In the gym we have a routine. From the moment the athlete steps through the front door their routine starts. An example might be:

* 10 minutes warm up
* 30 minutes condition
* 5 minutes stretching
* Head to beam
* 10 minutes complex on high
* 10 minutes dance skills
* 15 minutes series/acro
* 10 minutes dismount
* Head to bars (etc)

Now lets say little Susie has a fear of back handsprings on high beam. She knows that you will have the athletes do the following routine during those 15 minutes when they prepare to train series/acro:

* Stick 5 back handsprings on low beam
* Stick 5 back handsprings on medium beam
* Stick 5 back handsprings on high beam 

Though Susie may have no mechanical issues completing her back handspring and sticking the landing on low beam(or any beam for that matter) she may try to avoid completing your routine and in the process develop her own behavioral routine. Her routine to avoid doing the back handsprings might look like the following:

* Not stick the first 4 handspring attempts on low beam semi-intentionally
* Stick the next 5 knowing she wasted some time
* Not stick the next 7 handspring attempts on medium beam
* Stick a couple to ensure the coach doesn't catch on
* Finally right as you are about to be done with series/acro she might finish her medium beam attempts

It might not always be that obvious. The athlete might be the type that beats themselves up over it internally. Here are some examples of other routines:

* Stand there and prepare to go until the coach stops watching 
* Do the 5 seconds of dance before the skill then wobble in the dance then start over as if the dance wasn't good enough
* Start the skill then turn out a hip so the skill will inevitably push it to the side and the athlete doesn't have to put their feet on the beam or connect a second skill

There are similar routines the athletes do on other events such as bars:

* Death grip the bar
* Casting over to avoid giants

If you have an athlete that has fear issues you probably are sitting there screaming "But I never drilled that routine into them! How did it get there!". This behavioral routine is just part of the habit loop. The behavioral routine is just a small piece of a bigger picture that needs to be addressed. Let's get into a bit of the science behind all of this.



##Habit Loops:
One of my favorite books on the topic of human behavior is [The Power of Habit. Why we do what we do and how to change](http://amzn.to/1CHa2XW)
By Charles Duhigg. In this book he discusses the concept of a habit loop. 

The habit loop can be broken down into 3 parts:

###Cue:
An external stimulus that acts as a trigger. 

###Routine:
This is the exact sequence of actions that takes place once the brain has interpreted the aforementioned que. 

###Reward:
The brain's perceives result of the actions after they are taken.


####Example 1:
The most basic and well know expirement is [Pavlov's Dogs](http://www.simplypsychology.org/pavlov.html). This is a fairly well known experiment where Ivan Pavlov conditioned dogs to associate a bell ringing with dinner time. Over time the dogs would hear the bell and start to salivate in anticipation of dinner. Eventually the bell alone without food was enough to trigger the salivation. Lets break this down:

* Cue: The Bell
* Routine: The brain tells the body to start to salivate
* Reward: The various biological rewards we get from ingesting food

####Example 2:
As you can imagine there are both positive and negative behaviors. Here is a lesson most of us learn at a young age:

* Que: You see the pretty glow from something red hot
* Trigger: Curiosity dictates that you reach out and touch it
* Reward: Pain... lots of pain

So that pain you felt did not enforce the behavior but instead deter the behavior. Next time you see something glowing red the habit loop is a little different:

* Que: You see the pretty glow from something red hot
* Trigger: You run, hide, or cry to mom
* Reward: No pain

####Example 3:
This last one might hit a little closer to home.

* Que:  My coach asks me to do giants
* Behavior: I cast arch my back and fall over forward despite the fact I easily know how to cast to handstand
* Reward: My coach focuses on my cast instead and I don't have to do the scary giants

####How long does it take to form a habit loop?
It depends on the complexity of the routine, the severity of the reward, the frequency of the que. Some behaviors can be quickly learned by performing the habit loop once while others require many repetitions to enforce the habit loop. Let's examine some of the variables:

#####Complexity of Routine:
Due to the vast amount of muscles required to perform extremely precise tasks it often takes a long time to enforce a behavior such as a vault or a beam series. 

For example coaching a back handspring on floor is easier than a back handspring on beam because the actions needed to land safely on floor require much less precise timing and placement of body parts.

#####Severity of Reward:
Training fundamental body shapes rarely have a large and/or immediate reward that a young athlete will see. This makes it less likely to stick. 

On the other hand a negative reward such as a painful fall can alter an athlete's behavior routine extremely quickly.

#####Frequency of ques:
How frequently you train a skill or make a correction is important. If you only do basic shaping once a month or less the behavior is less likely to be enforced. 

Contrastly if an athlete observes other athletes or themselves enduring painful 'rewards' for their actions despite the fact the athlete themselves does not feel the pain then they will most likely craft habit loops that avoid those actions.



###Moving Forward:
Understanding that their behavior has 3 parts, the cue, the routine and the reward(or punishment), will allow us to easily understand where the fear is coming from and finally help our athletes through the issues. 

In the next chapter I will walk you through some basic ways I use to figure out the following:
* Which cues trigger the behavioral routines you and your athlete do not want
* How they were learned and how to avoid conditioning those bad habits in the future.
