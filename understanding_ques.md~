# Understanding Ques
_Nothing in life is to be feared, it is only to be understood. Now is the time to understand more, so that we may fear less._

The bad habbit is learned, your athelete is balking, now what? In order to fix it we need to fully understand the que, routine, reward loop the atheleat is expirencing. This section covers some simple tips and tricks on how to zero in on the bad ques. 

###Figure out the behavioral routine:
In the previous chapter I explained how the habit loop works. Now it is time to break down the unwanted habit loop and figure out where things are going wrong. I would recomend starting with the obvious, the unwanted behavioral routine. 

Often times its not just balking on the skill its self. Your athelete is smart and can think a step or two a head. Your athelete most likely is thinking something along the following "I am afraid of skill C. My coach always starts us with skill A, then B, then C. If I don't make it though A and B then I wont have to do C". This is the them developing a behavioral routine where they tank skill A, and B, and never even get to C. My point is sometimes the obvious behavior pattern we see is NOT the real root of the problem. 

Don't be mad. Chances are on some level the athelete is aware that they are afraid and not doing something wrong but I doubt they have plotted out some grand scheme to avoid the doing the skill. It is more of a defense mechnisim. The coach/parent getting mad doesn't help anything.

###Isolating Ques:

Assuming you have selected the exact(or aproximate) behavioral routine you are trying to fix then you need to look back and find the que that triggers it. In the above example skill A followed by skill B may seem to be the triggers but they are only a defense mechnisim, a ruse. There is some feeling that causes the athelete to balk.



#####Kinestetic:
Sometimes its a feeling like the falling while dropping into a giant that triggers the athelete loses shape or that falling backward feeling as an athelete sits into a backhandspring on the beam that triggers them to hop off to the side or take a step back. 

#####Visual: 
Sometimes its a visual thing, the athelete sees the table rapidly approching on a vault and stops or doesn't see the ground on a flip and whips their head out to find it.




The question now is what are these ques? You can't ask a young athelete "What is the que that triggers this unwanted behavioral routine?". Even the less technical "Why arent you going for your backhandspring?" is a tough question unless you have an athelete that is exceptionally talented at putting their most innter thoughts into words. Most college level atheletes I have encountered strugle with this so you can guess how difficult answering this question is with a younger athelete.

####Ask specific questions:
I have found asking broad questions wont get you to far here. Small focused questions work better. "What do you see as your falling into your giants? The X I drew between the bars where you should be pointing your toes? Your toes? The bar? Me, the coach?" or "What do you feel as your sitting back into your handspring?" work a lot better. You want to get as granular as possible. Remember were are most likely looking for a visual or haptic(feel) que. It is not to often an audible que triggers this kind of fear in gymnastics, possibly other sports. 



####Break down each step:
You will probablly get a lot of "I don't know" responses along the way but that is to be expected. Sometimes just asking is not enough. I recomend walking the athelete through the skill step by step their fore breaking it down into smaller actions that can then be isolated and examined to determine the exact que. Lets use vault as the example. 

#####Step 1:
Start by just having the athelete start their run. Focus on the first couple of steps. Then ask the athelete if those first couple of steps were the issue? 
This may seem a bit silly but that is partially the point: **To show the athelete how silly it is to be afraid of each part of the skill and their fore the skill as a whole.**


#####Step 2:
Assuming the previous step is not the issue(and I sincerly doubt it ever will be). Then have the athelete run almost to the table but vear out of the way of the table at the end. Again stop and walk through the run and ask the athelete what they saw and felt. Was there anything in there that triggered a behavior routine to avoid the vault?

#####Step 3:
Next try some hurdle drills with out the run to isolate the hurdle onto the board. For a Yurchanco you may want to break down the round off with a jump up. Ask the athelete how that feels? Is there a fear of the spring board. 


####Step 4:
Next do a full run to a jump up onto the table. Ask them how the felt or what they saw? If the start to balk here you can look at the new variable introduced here, the table, and we can be fairly certain the table is the scary part. 


For the sake of brevety I am not going to outline every step. You can use your imagination to come up with ways to isolate any skill on any event, breaking it down into its most simple of muscle motions and walking through them one at a time.  For our example lets just say our young athelete stops when it comes time to go over the table. It is not the run, it is not the board, its the table. 

####Once you hit a nerve:
You may want to alternate between the step that triggers the unwanted behavior and the previous step. Ask the athelete calmly what the difference is with what they see and what they feel between the two steps. It should become clearer with each repition but remember to keep switching between the two to help contrast the difference in the atheletes mind. Eventually hopefully the athelte will be able to articulate the exact que that triggers their defence mechinisim.


###Isolate the reward:
At this point you should look at what is the result of the que and behavioral routine. This is the "reward". For the above example "I don't have to go onto the big scary table". Once you know what they are trying to dodge you know what you need to fix. In our example not going over the table is only a reward as long as it is scary. If you can make the table less scary then it ceases to be a reward and their for will quickly negate the que, routine, reward habit loop.

##Coming up:
In the next set of chapters I will help you break down fear to help your atheletes understand what they are afraid of and get over it. //TODO: Add more this is a bad segway
