# Understanding Ques
_Nothing in life is to be feared, it is only to be understood. Now is the time to understand more, so that we may fear less._

The bad habbit is learned, your athelete is balking, now what? In order to fix it we need to fully understand the que, routine, reward loop the atheleat is expirencing. This section covers some simple tips and tricks on how to zero in on the bad ques. 

###Figure out the behavioral routine:
In the previous chapter I explained how the habit loop works. Now it is time to break down the unwanted habit loop and figure out where things are going wrong. I would recomend starting with the obvious, the unwanted behavioral routine. 

Often times its not just balking on the skill its self. Your athelete is smart and can think a step or two a head. Your athelete most likely is thinking something along the following "I am afraid of skill C. My coach always starts us with skill A, then B, then C. If I don't make it though A and B then I wont have to do C". This is the them developing a behavioral routine where they tank skill A, and B, and never even get to C. My point is sometimes the obvious behavior pattern we see is NOT the real root of the problem. 

Don't be mad. Chances are on some level the athelete is aware that they are afraid and not doing something wrong but I doubt they have plotted out some grand scheme to avoid the doing the skill. It is more of a defense mechnisim. The coach/parent getting mad doesn't help anything.

###Isolating Ques:

Assuming you have selected the exact(or aproximate) behavioral routine you are trying to fix then you need to look back and find the que that triggers it. In the above example skill A followed by skill B may seem to be the triggers but they are only a defense mechnisim, a ruse. There is some feeling that causes the athelete to balk.



#####Kinestetic:
Sometimes its a feeling like the falling while dropping into a giant that triggers the athelete loses shape or that falling backward feeling as an athelete sits into a backhandspring on the beam that triggers them to hop off to the side or take a step back. 

#####Visual: 
Sometimes its a visual thing, the athelete sees the table rapidly approching on a vault and stops or doesn't see the ground on a flip and whips their head out to find it.




The question now is what are these ques? You can't ask a young athelete "What is the que that triggers this unwanted behavioral routine?". Even the less technical "Why arent you going for your backhandspring?" is a tough question unless you have an athelete that is exceptionally talented at putting their most innter thoughts into words. Most college level atheletes I have encountered strugle with this so you can guess how difficult answering this question is with a younger athelete.

####Ask specific questions:









####Visualize each step, 



###Isolate the reward:


###Uncertanty is fear:
