# Understanding Ques
_Nothing in life is to be feared, it is only to be understood. Now is the time to understand more, so that we may fear less._

This section is on how to address existing issues. The unwanted habit is learned, your athlete is balking, now what? In order to fix it we need to fully understand the cue, routine, reward loop the athlete is experiencing. Now it is time to break down the unwanted habit loop and figure out where things are going wrong.

###Figure out the behavioral routine:
Often times the problem does not start with just balking on the skill itself. Your athlete is smart and can think a step or two a head. Your athlete most likely is thinking something along the following:

_"I am afraid of skill C. My coach always starts us with skill A, then B, then C. If I don't make it through A and B then I won't have to do C". _

Sometimes the obvious behavior pattern we see is NOT the real root of the problem.
 
Don't be mad. Chances are on some level the athlete is aware that they are afraid and doing something wrong but I doubt they have plotted out some grand scheme to decive you avoid the doing the skill. It's not like there sitting there saying:

_"I am not going to go for my skills just to piss everyone off"_.

Think of it more like a natural defense mechanism. Chances are their thought process was more along the lines of 

_"The result of my previous actions or actions I have observed (the reward) was negative so I am going to figure out how not to do that again"_.

Stay calm and break it down; getting mad doesn't help anything.

###Isolating Ques:

Assuming you have selected the exact(or approximate) behavioral routine you are trying to fix then you need to look back and find the cue that triggers it. In the above example skill A followed by skill B may seem to be the triggers but they are only a defense mechanism, a ruse. 


If the athelete has expirenced pain then it is probablly the a feeling strongly associated with the skill, like the last thing they felt/saw before they felt the pain. If the athelete has not endured injury during this then it might just be the feeling of something they are not used to that triggers the defense mechnisims. This means it could be a far wider set of ques.
Either way there is a trigger causes the athlete to balk on the skill.

#####Haptic:
Sometimes itâ€™s something the athelete feels: 

* The free falling while dropping into a giant that triggers the athlete to lose shape.
* The leaning backward feeling as an athlete sits into a back handspring on the beam that triggers them to hop off to the side or take a step back. 

#####Visual: 
Sometimes it's something they see visually: 

* The athlete sees the table rapidly approaching as they run tward it on a vault and vears to the side.
* They don't see the ground on a flip and whip their head out to spot the ground.


###Getting to the bottom of it:
What are the ques specific to your athelete? You could try asking an athlete "What is the cue that triggers this unwanted behavioral routine?" or "Why aren't you going for your backhandspring?". Unless you have an athlete that is exceptionally talented at putting their most inner thoughts into words you will probablly hear something like "I dont know". 

####Ask specific questions:
Asking broad questions won't get you to far here. Small focused questions work better. "What do you see as your falling into your giants? The X I drew on the base mat between the bars where you should be pointing your toes? Your toes? The bar? Me, the coach?" or "What do you feel as you're sitting back into your handspring?" work a lot better. You want to get as granular as possible. Remember we are most likely looking for a visual or haptic(feel) que. Audible cue might be more previlant in other sports but it is not to often they trigger this kind of fear in gymnastics.  



####Break down each step:
You will probably get a lot of "I don't know" responses along the way but that is to be expected. Sometimes just asking is not enough. I recommend walking the athlete through the skill step by step. Try breaking it down into smaller actions that can then be isolated and examined to determine the exact que. Lets use vault as the example. 

#####Step 1:
Start by just having the athlete start their run. Focus on the first couple of steps. Then ask the athlete if those first couple of steps were the issue? 
This may seem a bit silly but that is partially the point: **To show the athlete how silly it is to be afraid of each part of the skill and their fore the skill as a whole.**


#####Step 2:
Assuming the previous step is not the issue(and I sincerely doubt it ever will be). Then have the athlete run almost to the table but vear out of the way of the table at the end. Again stop and walk through the run and ask the athlete what they saw and felt. Was there anything in here that triggered a behavior routine to avoid the vault?

#####Step 3:
Next try some hurdle drills without the run to isolate the hurdle onto the board. For a Yurchanko vault you may want to break down the round off with a jump up. Ask the athlete how that feels? Is there a fear of the spring board?


####Step 4:
Next do a full run to a jump up onto the table. Ask them how they felt or what they saw? If they start to balk here you can look at the new variable introduced here: the table.


For the sake of brevity I am not going to outline every step. You can use your imagination to come up with ways to isolate any skill on any event, or any sport for that matter. Break it down into its most simple of muscle motions and walk through them one step at a time. 

####Once you hit a nerve:
You may want to alternate between the step that triggers the unwanted behavior and the previous step. Ask the athlete calmly what the difference is with what they see and what they feel between the two steps. It should become clearer with each repetition. Remember to keep switching between the two steps to help contrast the difference in the athlete's mind. Eventually hopefully the athlete will be able to articulate the exact cue that triggers their defence mechanism.


###Isolate the reward:
At this point you should look at what the result of the que and behavioral routine is. This is the "reward". For the above example the reward is "I don't have to go onto the big scary table". Once you know what they are trying to dodge you know what you need to fix. In our example not going over the table is only a reward as long as it is scary. If you can make the table less scary than it ceases to be a reward and their fore will quickly negate the cue, routine, reward habit loop.

##Coming up:
In the next set of chapters I will help you:
* Break down fear to help your athletes understand what they are afraid of
* Remove uncertanty from the equasion
* Empower your atheletes so they feel safer
* Use positive mental association

And much more.
