In the last chapter we were able to zero in on the exact cues and behavioral routines that is causing the athlete to avoid going for the big skill. Now it is time to help the athlete through their fear issue. The easiest way I find is to help the athlete understand the what they are afraid of.

What causes fear: **uncertainty**. 
 * Uncertainty of the outcome of your actions.
 * Uncertainty of the environment around you. 

Uncertainty of pretty much anything can cause fear. 

###The monster under the bed:
Have you ever heard of a small child throwing a tantrum at bedtime because they have an irrational fear of the monster under the bed? To an adult this seems completely irrational, but to the child it seems like a matter of life and death. The question is:

 _Where did this irrational fear come from?_

The answer: **uncertainty**. 

Because the child is uncertain of what is actually under there their mind fills in the void with what seems like a logical possibility at that age:

_It's dark and I can't see it so there is probably a monster in it._

What if you turned on the lights, lifted up the bed, and let the child look under the bed before bedtime? The child can look under the bed and see for themselves. This removes a small amount of uncertainty from the child and their for removes some amount of fear.

Perhaps you can to continually reassure there are no monsters in the dark so you add a night light so they can look anytime they want and be sure the room is clear of nefarious creatures.

###What scares us adults:
Think about what you as an adult are afraid of. Since I consult on a contract basis as my primary form of income what keeps me up at night in a cold sweat is the uncertainty of when that next contract will land. Financial uncertainty a constant source of terror for me and many other adults. 

###Fear vs Respect:
Are you afraid of the hot burners on your stove? Arguably your stoves hot burners could cause far more severe physical and immediate pain then your financial woes. So why aren't you afraid of your stove?

Because you know 100% what will happen if you place your hand on a hot burner: **It will hurt a lot, duh.**

You also know exactly what you can do to avoid such pain: **Don't touch the burner!**

You know the exact actions you control that dictate the outcome of your interactions with the stove. In your mind you can be certain of the outcome so there is nothing to fear. It is no different with your athletes. 


#Going into the pit
Often times when teaching uneven bars I encounter girls with a fairly severe fear of going for their giants on high bar even over the open foam pit. Here is a mental exercise I use with my athletes to help remove uncertainty in their minds.

Me: "What are you afraid of?"

Athlete: "I don't Know" - This is expected

Me: "What do you think is going to happen if you cast to handstand?"

Athlete: "You are going to make me do a giant"

Me: "Then what will happen?"

Athlete: "I might ping or fall" - They jump right to the worst case scenario

Me: "Okay, and where will you end up?" - I point at the pit

Athlete: "...In the pit?"

Me: "Have you ever been in the pit before?" - A silly question but I want them to realize how silly a fear of going into the pit would be

Athlete:"Yes"

Me: "Cool, so you know what it is like right?" - This is intended to show that the foam pit is a **familiar place they have been before and does not contain any uncertainties**, just foam.

Athlete: "Yes" - If they were to say 'no' I would have them jump in a handful of times until they are familiar and comfortable

Me: "Are you afraid of the pit? Is there a pit monster?" - Again another question aimed to point out how irrational a fear of the pit would be

Athlete: "No"

Me: "Okay now lets say you go for the giant and make it around. I am going to tell you 'great job' now hop off the bar and into the..."

Athlete: "The pit"

Me: "So if you do your giants you are going into the pit?" - A question aimed to make them realize the worse case scenario and the best case scenario have basically the same outcome

Athlete: "...yes"

Me: "Okay so lets say you decide your not going to go for it? In order to get down your going to need to jump into the...." - At this point hopefully they realize that all paths lead into the foam pit

Athlete: "...into the pit"
Me: "What are the chances that you will let go and fly away through the roof and end up in space?" - Another exaggeration to illustrate the irrationality of their fear. 

Athlete:"Zero"

Me: "So no matter what your going to end up in the...?"

Athlete: "The pit..."

Me:"The only difference is how you are going to feel afterward. If you go over the bar and try your giant how do you think you will feel?" 

Athlete: "Good"

Me: "You should, it will be awesome. How about if you jump down without trying?"

Athlete: "I don't know, not good" 

Me:"Probably not great. That is the big difference. You know no matter what your going in the pit. Now the choice is yours: You can drop down into the pit without going and you will probably feel blah or you can get up there on the bar and have a good chance of feeling like a rockstar. The choice is yours!"

I have had this conversation literally hundreds of times. Yes the events, aperateratouses and skills change but the principal is the same: **If you can remove uncertainty from the equation then you can remove fear**.

Gymnastics coaches will probably thinking "But approach will not work when getting kids to swing the giant outside of the foam pit? What about on regular bar?". Lets be honest even the pit is not 100% safe. 90% maybe but nothing is 100%. We as coaches are responsible to build a training environment at each stage of the training process that can remove the possibility of catastrophic injury beyond a reasonable doubt. There are plenty of techniques for doing this: Adding additional matting, spotting belt, hand spotting the skill, etc. Unfortunately what seems like a reasonable doubt to us, to the lawyers, and to the athlete are three different things but still you must try and make it as safe as possible.

##Conclusion:
In the upcoming chapters we will go through more of those tips and tricks to make this all possible. For now just remember fear is caused by uncertainty. Remove uncertainty and you will remove fear.
