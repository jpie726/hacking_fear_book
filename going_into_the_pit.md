In the last chapter we were able to zero in on the exact fear the athelete has. It is not some magical **mental block**! It is in fact just a habit loop learned and reenforced over time. Your job as the coach(or potentially parent) is to help the athelete through the fear. The easiest way I find is to help the athelete understand the fear.

What is fear? Fear is uncertanty. Uncertanty of the out come of your actions. Uncertanty of the enviroment around you. Uncertanty of pretty much anything can cause fear. Allow me to illistrate my point:

###The moster under the bed:
Have you ever heard of a small child throwing a tantrum at bed time because they have an irrational fear of the monster under the bed? To an adult this seems completely irrational, but to the child it seems like a matter of life and death. The question is where did this irrational fear come from? The answer: uncertanty. Because the child is uncertain of what is actually under there their mind fills in the void with what seems like a logical possibility at that age. It's dark and I can't see it so there is probabbly a monster in it.

What if you turned on the lights, lifted up the bed, and let the child look under the bed before bedtime? The child can look under the bed and see for themselfs. This removes a small amount of uncertanty from the child and their for removes some amount of fear.

###What scares us adults:
Think about what you as an adult are afraid of. I will tell you what keeps me up at night in a cold sweat: Since I often times consult the uncertanty of then that next contract will land can be a constant source of terror. 

Are you afraid of the hot burners on your stove? Arguablly your stoves hot burners could cause far more sevear physical and imediate pain then your finincial woes. So why arn't you afraid of your stove?

Because you know 100% what will happen if you place your hand on a hot burner: **It will hurt a lot, duh.**

You also know exactly what you can do to avoid such pain: **Dont touch the burner!**

You know the exact actions you control that dictate the outcome of your interactions with the stove. In your mind you can be certain of the outcome so there is nothing to fear. It is no different with your atheletes. 


#Going into the pit
Often times when teaching giants I encounter girls with a fairly severe fear of going for their giants on high bar over the open foam pit. Here is a mental exercise I use with my atheletes to help remove uncertanty in their minds.

Me: "What are you afraid of?"
Athelete: "I dont Know" - This is expected
Me: "What do you think is going to happen if you cast to handstand?"
Athelete: "You are going to make me do a giant"
Me: "Then what will happen?"
Athelete: "I might ping or fall" - A worst case scenerio
Me: "Okay, and where will you end up?" - I point at the pit
Athelete: "...In the pit?"
Me: "Have you ever been in the pit before?" - A silly question but I want them to realize how silly a fear of going into the pit might be
Athelete:"Yes"
Me: "Cool, so you know what it is like right?" - This is intended to show that the foam pit is a familiar place they have been before and does not contain any uncertanties, just foam.
Athelete: "Yes" - If they were to say 'no' I would have them jump in a hand full of times until they are familar and comphortable
Me: "Are you afraid of the pit? Is there a pit monster?" - Again another question aimed to point out how irrational a fear of the pit might be
Athelete: "No"
Me: "Okay now lets say you go for the giant and make it around. I am going to tell you 'great job' now hop off the bar and into the..." 
Athelete: "The pit"
Me: "So if you do your giants you are going into the pit?" - A question aimed to make them realize the worse case scenerio and the best case scenerio have basically the same outcome
Athelete: "...yes"
Me: "Okay so lets say you decide your not going to go for it? In order to get down your going to need to jump into the...." - At this point hopefully they realize that all paths lead into the foam pit
Athelete: "...into the pit"
Me: "What are the chances that you will let go and fly away through the roof and end up in space?" - Another exhaduration to illistrait the irrationality of their fear. 
Athelete:"Zero"
Me: "So no matter what your going to end up in the...?"
Athelete: "The pit..."
Me: "So no matter what you will be pretty safe right?"
Athelete:"Yes"
Me:"The only diference is how you are going to feel afterward. If you go over the bar and try your giant how do you think you will feel?" 
Athelete: "Good"
Me: "You should, it will be awesome. How about if you jump down without trying?"
Athelete: "I don't know, not good" 
Me:"Probablly not great. That is the big difference. You know no matter what your going in the pit. Now the choice is yours: You can drop down into the pit without going and you will probablly feel blah or you can get up there on the bar and have a good chance of feeling like a rockstar. The choice is yours!"

I have had this conversation literally hundreds of times. Yes the events, aperateratouses and skills change but the principal is the same. If you can remove uncertanty from the equasion then you can remove fear.

Now gymnastics coaches will probablly thinking "But approch will not work when getting kids to swing the giant out side of the foam pit? What about on regular bar?" Well lets be honest even the pit is not 100% safe. 90% maybe but nothing is 100%. We as coaches are responsable to build a training enviroment at each stage of the training process that can remove the possibility of catastrophic injury beyond a reasonable doubt. 

There are plenty of techniques for doing this: Adding additional matting, spotting belt, hand spotting the skill, etc. But this is only the start, the question is how to get the athelete ready to perform the skill with acceptable competitive matting. ....----idk

In the up coming chapters we will go through more of those tips and tricks. For now just remember fear is caused by uncertanty. Remove uncertanty and you will remove fear.
