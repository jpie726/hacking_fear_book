In the last chapter we were able to zero in on the exact fear the athelete has. It is not some magical **mental block**! It is in fact just a habit loop learned and reenforced over time. Your job as the coach(or potentially parent) is to help the athelete through the fear. The easiest way I find is to help the athelete understand the fear.

What is fear? Fear is uncertanty. Uncertanty of the out come of your actions. Uncertanty of the enviroment around you. Uncertanty of pretty much anything can cause fear. Allow me to illistrate my point:

###The moster under the bed:
Have you ever heard of a small child throwing a tantrum at bed time because they have an irrational fear of the monster under the bed? To an adult this seems completely irrational, but to the child it seems like a matter of life and death. The question is where did this irrational fear come from? The answer: uncertanty. Because the child is uncertain of what is actually under there their mind fills in the void with what seems like a logical possibility at that age. It's dark and I can't see it so there is probabbly a monster in it.

What if you turned on the lights, lifted up the bed, and let the child look under the bed before bedtime? The child can look under the bed and see for themselfs. This removes a small amount of uncertanty from the child and their for removes some amount of fear.

###What scares us adults:
Think about what you as an adult are afraid of. I will tell you what keeps me up at night in a cold sweat: Since I often times consult the uncertanty of then that next contract will land can be a constant source of terror. 

Are you afraid of the hot burners on your stove? Arguablly your stoves hot burners could cause far more sevear physical and imediate pain then your finincial woes. So why arn't you afraid of your stove?

Because you know 100% what will happen if you place your hand on a hot burner: **It will hurt a lot, duh.**

You also know exactly what you can do to avoid such pain: **Dont touch the burner!**

There is certainty there.
