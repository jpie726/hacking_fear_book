In the last chapter we were able to zero in on the exact fear the athelete has. It is not some magical **mental block**! It is in fact just a habit loop learned and reenforced over time. Your job as the coach(or potentially parent) is to help the athelete through the fear. The easiest way I find is to help the athelete understand the fear.

What is fear? Fear is uncertanty. Lets look back at my earlier example about giving the monster under the bed a name. Once you give it a name it becomes real in their minds. What if instead of giving it a name you turned on the lights, lifted up the bed, and let the child look under the bed? The child can look under the bed and see for them selfs. This removes a small amount of uncertanty from the child. 


Think about what you as an adult are afraid of. I will tell you what keeps me up at night in a cold sweat: Since I often times consult the uncertanty of then that next contract will land can be a constant source of terror.
