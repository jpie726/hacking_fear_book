# Debugging/Fixing Habit Loops
This chapter is where my computer skills start to come in handy. You see in order to build secure web applications you need to know a little about the dark arts of hacking. Using similar techniques I have used to disrupt computer loops and alter a systems behavior I have had success appling them to my atheletes to disrupt unwanted habit loops and alter their unwanted behavior routines.

###Disruption:
When a system expects a number and you put in letters this is a form of disruption. The same can be applied to an atheletes habit loop to by pass the que that triggers the behavior that prevents them from completing their skills.



####Progression Ques(TODO: Find a better name):
For example lets say the athelete is afraid of skill c and they know that during pratice the coach has them start with skill A, then skill B, then skill C. Skill A followed by Skill B becomes the que to trigger the unwanted behavior. Try mixing it up a little, supprise them. Switch back to basics when they don't expect it. 

Often times I am asked by other coaches to help their atheletes get through their fear issues. The coach will tell the athelete "Go work with Matt on your giants" and the athelete will tense up expecting me to toss them right up on the bar. I will then spend the next 20 minutes doing shaping drills, backextension rolls, and floor drills. Once the athelete is comfortable and I am happy with their basics we will eventually make our way to the real bar. Again they tense up in anticipation of the impending giant. I will then have them do tap swings, perhaps some casts, a hand full of clear hip circles focusing on grip flip until they big scary giant swing is back of mind. Finally we work our way to the point where the athelete's defenses are down and they no longer have their defense up. Now it is time to start thinking about working that big end skill, before you do I want to review some other points with you. 

####Verbal Ques:
If they are afraid of giants dont call them 'giants'. I am not saying lie to them, but 'a rose by any other name'. Like I have been saying all along, break down the skill into its components. "Were going to do a cast handstand drop into a long hang pullover miss your hips and then finish like a back extension roll". If you are a gymnastics person then you know I pretty much described a giant in lessor terms. I would never tell a kid that whole thing but I would happily start out with a baby giant then tell the child just to focus on two key peaces like the "hollow fall" and "finishing like a backextension roll to handstand".

If you can dodge the easily avoidable verbal ques that trigger the defense mechnisim. Even once the athelete throws one or two of them because they didn't realize what they were doing exactly I am hesitant to use the word for fear that it might cause the defensive behavorial routine to kick back in. Just be patient and keep it simple.


####Enviroment Ques:
Another advantage of being a camp coach is that it is a brand new enviroment that the athelete has few if any preexising ques. I mean a vault table is a vault table and a beam is a beam. Some ques will presist but lets look at all of the other aspects of the enviroment that is different:
* The series of events that make up a daily pratice
* The coaching staff and the tequniques they use
* The facility
* The group dynamics are altered by the other children that are not on your team

All of this new stimuli might be enough to overwhelm them enough to forget their fear or the complete change of enviroment might just be different enough the ques don't get triggered in quite the same way.  Eather way its a huge advantage I have hear at camp to overcome unwanted behavioral routines.

You can use similar approches by tweaking similar variables. You could go to a camp or you could go to a friendly gym. You might not need to change the entire enviroment, try doing your drills in a different part of the gym or try brining the athelete in at a different time of day. Change your groupings, or switch coaches. Mix it up and keep them guessing a little. This will help you disrupt the unwanted habit loop.

#####Coaches Body Language can be an inhibitor
//Perhaps move this to that last chapter



###Association:
Once you have successfully disrupted the unwanted habit loop it is time to start building the habit loops you want your athelete to have. This is easier said then done. 

Before you start digging back in and training your athelete to perform those increadibly percise actions you may want to be a little proactive in order to silence that voice in the back of their head. What do I mean by 'voice in the back of their head'? I am talking about when you start making some progress with your athelete and all of the suddon that little voice in the back of their head kicks in and starts screaming "Don't do it!" then they start freezing up and the unwanted habit loop comes back. That is what I mean by 'voice in the back of their head'. There is no visual que, no haptic(feel) que, just the atheletes mind screaming "don't do it". Lets examine the potential causes of this first.


####Random Backstory(//TODO: Better Title)
All through school I had trouble focusing on what the teacher was saying. My mother refused to medicate me and I sincerly thank her for it now. At time I strugled until when I was a sophmore in highschool I had a revolation. I found in history and english I could doodle and absorb what the teacher was saying. Interestingly enough this did not work in math. It also didn't work in classes where I needed to engage visually but it sure made listening to lectures easier. 

To this day I absorb audio books at a remakable pace. I have expanded the activities I can engage in while absorbing audible(non numeric) information to the following:
* Computer programming
* Drawing
* Working out(assuming it is repitive cardio or a lifting routine I am familar with)

Interestingly enough when I tried other activities while listening to audible information I was almost completely unable process it. Activities such as:
* Having a conversation
* Reading pretty much anything
* Writing pretty much anything

Knowing all of this I had to ask the question "Why did performing some activities allow to focus and perform better while others completely conflicted? Here is my explination:

####Dueling Hemispheres:
__Before I get into this next little bit I want to disclaimer this by restating the fact that I do **not have a PHD in neuro science**. This a theoretical explination based on the reading I have done as a hobbyiest on findings by people with those fancy degrees. Even they don't all agree. As a matter of fact they seem to take great joy in poking holes in each others theories as I am sure they will with this one. I strongly suggest you use the tools available to you to do your own research when you get a chance. I mean don't go disecting anyones brain or anything but read up. In the mean time here is a potential explination for how the association effect works.__

One potential explination is lateralization of brain functions between the two cerebral hemispheres. This is an area still under strong research but bare with me for a moment while we hypothisize. What if occupying one section of the brain with a simple task allowed the other to opporate with out inturuption? Occupying the portion of my brain used to process visual information or repetitive physical actions seems to free the other side to absorb.

This lead me to wonder if the opposite was true. If I occupied the side that processed that audible information, that 'voice in the back of my head' then would that free the portion of the brain that is used to preform predetermined pyhsical routines?

####Putting words to it:
In 2013 I had the good fortune to attend a coaching clinic by an olympian on the mental side of the sport(I hope in future drafts of this book she will give me permission to use her name). It was an amazing clinic that opened my eyes to some great phylosophies and tequniques for dealing with fear. One of the things that really resinated with me was that she created audible ques to go along with her beam and floor routines.

I, not being primarily an audibal learner, had not thought of putting words to the skills I trained nor the skills of the atheletes I was training. 

Perhaps the presence of audible ques in the form of the music played along with a floor routine and the absence of any audible ques on beam can explain why you see so much more balking the beam then floor.



##In pratice/ My mothers cooking:


* * * Dueling Hemospheres/Elise Ray
* * Repition
* * * Michael Phelps vs my old vaulters
* * * Vocal Ques
* * * Beam
* * * Communication Types - Audiable
* * Progressing to the goal
* * * Don't say the skill - Its a bad que
* * * Stay calm
* * * Little Flogal - Cast Long Hang Pullover to handstand

###Take the mystery out of it by focus on what they can control:(POSSIBLY MOVE TO PREVIOUS CHAPTER)
Remember the child that was afraid of the moster under the bed from our earlier example? We removed some uncertanty from their mind by showing them there is no moster under the bed. What if we took it a step forward by putting some control into their hands. What if we left them a flash light on their night stand so that any time they felt that mean old monster might be under the bed they could check for them selfs. 

Putting a little control in the atheletes hands is a powerful thing. Often times the control is already there they just don't realize it. I mean its not you the coach/parent that controls the atheletes body. It's all them. Once you show them how much they actually control


//Skill peaces

Giant tap



//Blinders for everything else

//Verbage "Own it" - Not just the skill but the floor and everything else.





####Verbage:
I talked about this in the previous section where I discussed the difference between diagnosing an athelete with a "mental block" versus telling them they are "over thinking" something. This is because it is difficult to figure out what action to take to remove a _mental block_ but it is easier to figure out what action to take to counter act "over thinking": Either don't think about the skill or think about the peaces of the skill instead of the big scary skill as a whole. The point is the verbage I use and encourage the atheletes to use is **actionable**.

Antoher phraseing I am adamte about correcting is the "I am bad at X" logic. If the athelete has it in their head that they are just "bad at bars" then why, why, why would they put any effort into bars. They are far more likely to focus on the events they feel they have a half a chance at. Again this is a **self fulfilling prophecy** and will encourage behavior that brings the "bad" statment to fruishion instead of creating actions against it. 

What happens when I rephrase it to "I need to improve X"? This leads to the next question "What can I do to improve X?". The answer of that question then leads the athelete to a solid list of actions that they can pratice until the habit loop you want them to learn is cemented into their brain. Isn't that alot easier?

Stating a single skill or routine "needs improvment" then proceeding to explain how to improve the skill works well but what about using it as a blanket labeling statment to describe the atheleate? As in "You need improvment on bars"? This is different but in my opion still fine as long as you can provide specific feedback on how they need to improve. "Susie needs to improve her bars and here are the actions she needs to take to improve them". Once she takes those actions she has improved her bars and the personal label is no longer really applicable. Even if the athelete still feels that their bars could use improvment as they progress and get older, is it the worst thing that they want to continue to improve even beyond the point that is considered good enough?

####Natural Talent:
Now I will be honest: it is not all sunshine and rainbows. It is true that not everyone is born with the same natural talent. Some people are naturals, and some have to work really hard to even make an inch of progress tward their goals. I am not encouraging you to decive all of your atheletes into beliving that. The highest level athelete I have ever had the pleasure of coaching was one of the least naturally talented.

It can be equally as dangerious to allow your more _naturally talented_ atheletes to belive that is will all come naturally to them. This can easily lead to the illusion that everything will come easy. Perhaps that first 80% of the way will but that last 20% will require more effort then your athelete may be prepaired to put in. You can never be sure when they will cease to be able to coast through on their natural talent and it becomes an up hill battle but when it does you want your atheletes prepaired to push through it.

What I would encourage is to have your atheletes focus on being "hard workers" not only that but "smart workers". I strong appreaciation for the fundementails .....
