#Behavioral Routines and Habit Loops:
In gymnastics we train our athletes to complete routines right? A complex set of precise actions designed by us, the coaches. 

The same can be said for Football, Baseball, Cheerleading, Martial Arts, etc their routines are just much smaller and change based on the other players actions. Think about the exact order that all of the various muscles must fire to throw a spiral touchdown pass or to successfully sweep your opponent to the ground while grappling. All of these are tiny routines that we learn and tweak over time.

You even have a daily routine. Here is my morning routine:

* Wake up at 5am
* Eat a granola bar and 1/2 a caffeine tablet
* Meditate/be greatful for 10 minutes
* Put my daily meals into my backpack
* Head to the gym
* Work out for 90 minutes
* Shower, brush teeth etc 
* Head into the office
* Write for 90 minutes
* Review my todo list and start working

Think about your morning routine, does it change often? 

In the gym we have a routine. From the moment the athlete steps through the front door their routine starts. An example might be:

* 10 minutes warm up
* 30 minutes condition
* 5 minutes stretching
* Head to beam
* 10 minutes complex on high
* 10 minutes dance skills
* 15 minutes series/acro
* 10 minutes dismount
* Head to bars (etc)

Now lets say little Susie has  a fear of backhand springs on high beam. She knows that you will have the athletes do the following routine during those 15 minutes when they do series/acro:

* Stick 5 on low beam
* Stick 5 on medium beam
* Stick 5 on high beam 

Though Susie may have no mechanical issues completing her back handspring and sticking on low beam(or any beam for that matter) she may try to avoid completing your routine and in the process develop her own routine. Her routine to avoid doing the back handsprings might look like:

* Not stick the first 4 handspring attempts
* Stick the next knowing she wasted some time with first
* Not stick the next 7 handspring attempts on medium
* Stick a couple to ensure you don't catch on
* Finally right as you are about to be done with series/acro she might finish her medium beam attempts

It might not always be that obvious. She might be the type that beats herself up over it. Here are some examples of other routines:

* Stand there and prepare to go until the coach stops watching 
* Do the 5 seconds of dance before the skill then wobble in the dance then start over as if the dance wasn't good enough
* Start the skill then turn out a hip so the skill  will inevitably push it to the side and she doesn't have to put her feet on the beam or connect a second skill

There are similar routines the athletes do on other events such as bars:

* Death grip the bar
* Casting over to avoid giants

If you have an athlete that has fear issues you probably are sitting there screaming "But I never drilled that routine into them! How did it get there!". The routine is just part of the habit loop, there is a lot more to it than just that. Let's get into a bit of the science behind all of this.



##Habit Loops:
One of my favorite books on the topic of human behavior is [The Power of Habit. Why we do what we do and how to change](http://amzn.to/1CHa2XW)
By Charles Duhigg. In this book he discusses the concept of a habit loop. A habit loop is what makes up perform various behaviors. 

The habit loop can be broken down into 3 parts:

* Que - The trigger that determines which habit fires off and when
* Routine - The exact set of actions that takes place once the brain has recognized the que
* Reward - The result of your actions that the brain perceives. Each time this reward is realized it re enforces the habit loop.
 
Each habit can be broken down this way:
####Example 1:
The most basic and well know expirement is [Pavlov's Dogs](http://www.simplypsychology.org/pavlov.html). This is a fairly well known experiment where Ivan Pavlov conditioned dogs to associate a bell ringing with dinner time. Over time the dogs would hear the bell and start to salivate in anticipation of dinner. Eventually the bell alone was enough to trigger the salivation. Lets break this down:

* Cue: The Bell
* Routine: The brain tells the body to start to salivate
* Reward: The food, and the spike in blood sugar and other various rewards we get from ingesting foot

####Example 2:
As you can imagine there is both positive and negative behaviors. Here is a lesson most of us learn as a kid sometime:

* Que: You see the pretty glow from something red hot
* Trigger: Curiosity dictates that you reach out and touch it
* Reward: Pain... lots of pain

So that pain you felt did not enforce the behavior but instead deter the behavior. Next time you see something glowing red the habit loop is a little different:

* Que: You see the pretty glow from something red hot
* Trigger: You run, hide, cry to mom
* Reward: No pain

####Example 3:
This last one might hit a little closer to home.

* Que:  My coach asks me to do giants
* Behavior: I cast over despite the fact I easily know how
* Reward: My coach focuses on my cast instead and I don't have to do the scary giants

####How long does it take to form a habit loop?
It depends on the complexity of the routine, the severity of the reward, the frequency of the que. 

#####Complexity of Routine:
When coaching we try and enforce the mental routines through repetition after repetition. Due to the vast amount of muscles required to perform extremely precise tasks it often takes a long time to enforce a behavior such as a vault or a beam series.

#####Severity of Reward:
Training fundamental body shapes rarely have a large and/or immediate reward that a young athlete will see. This makes it less likely to stick. 

On the other hand a negative reward such as a painful fall can alter an athlete's behavior routine extremely quickly.

#####Frequency of ques:
How frequently do you train a skill or make a correction is important. If you only do basic shaping once a month or less the behavior is less likely to be enforced. Similar if an athlete observes other athletes or themselves enduring painful rewards for their actions then they will most likely craft habit loops that avoid those actions.



###Moving Forward:
Understanding that their behavior has 3 parts, the cue, the routine and the reward(or punishment), will allow us to easily understand where the fear is coming from and finally help our athletes through the issues. 

In the next chapter I will walk you through some basic ways I use to figure out what ques trigger the bad routines, how they were learned and how to avoid conditioning those bad habits in the future.
