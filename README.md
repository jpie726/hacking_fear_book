##Intro:

###Problem:
//Need a story...

###This books solution:
This book contains tips, tricks, phylosphies and stratigies I have developed or adapted from other people to help my athaleates overcome fear issues. 

This book contains a lot of gymnastics references but the lessions can be applied to most any sport or even life in general.

###Who am I:
Your probablly asking what makes you a expert on this topic Matt? If you are not you should be. 

Well I do NOT a dorctorit in neuro-sceintist, and I no kid I have coached has ever gone to the olympics(yet).

No. Oddly enough coaching gymnastics, is not even technically my full time carreer as in I don't do it for the money. Coaching Gymnastics is my passion, and I assume yours if you take the time to read this.

What I do to make money is archetect large scale web applications.

Try googling "Matt Lea Wall Street Journal" or "Tech Crunch Disrupt Hackathon Winner 2012 Livebolt".

My occupation is relivant to gymnastics because through out this book I will use my analytical computer/debugging skills to show you new tricks and tips not widly used in coaching to help you help your atheltes through their fear issues.

####Just a camp coach:

//Testing learning/etc


###How to use this book:

//Not strictly

//A bunch of tools to put into your repitwa

//Not just for gymnastics but ofr life
