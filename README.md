_BEFORE READING THIS DRAFT: If you are reading this draft of the book it is my first draft. I started writing this book 2 weeks ago while here at camp as a mental exercise for myself. This first draft is NOT a final draft. It is intended to grab the early feedback that is key to writing any quality work. By reading this and providing feedback YOU are becoming part of the book publishing process and I(Matt Lea) truly appreciate it._


##Intro:
Have you ever had to battle the fear monster when working with an athlete? Have you ever watched the athlete repeat the same behavior over and over again as if stuck in an painful loop? Ever wish you could break the loop and help them on the path to successfully beating that bad behavior pattern know as fear?

This book contains tips, tricks, philosophies and strategies I have developed or adapted from other people to help my athletes overcome fear issues. 

This book contains a lot of gymnastics references but the lessons can be applied to most any sport or performance based art.

###Who am I:
Before you start reading you should know the facts:

 I do NOT a doctorate in neuroscience
No kid I have coached has ever gone to the olympics(yet).
I am not some fancy psychologist

No. Oddly enough coaching gymnastics, is not even technically my full time career as in I don't do it for the money. Coaching Gymnastics is my passion, and I assume yours if you take the time to read this.

What I do to make money is architect large scale web applications. Try googling "Matt Lea Wall Street Journal" or "Tech Crunch Disrupt Hackathon Winner 2012 Livebolt" for some fun reads on my adventures in tech startup land.

My occupation as a web application architect is relevant here because throughout this book I will use my analytical computer/debugging skills to show you new tricks and tips not widely used in coaching to help you help your athletes through their fear issues.

In addition to over a decade of coaching competitive gymnastics at an optional level or higher another advantage I have is throughout my life starting at age 19 I have coached at various gymnastics camps. 

This has afforded me the opportunity to have worked with literally thousands of athletes over the years testing different techniques for dealing with fear. Since not all athletes are the same and what works with one kid doesnâ€™t always work with another there is a huge advantage to being able to test and gather data on a wide cross section of personality types and scenarios.


###How to use this book:
This book is not meant to be used like an instruction manual or a scientific report. It is merely a series of tips and tricks to add to your arsonal. There are some high level concepts I recommend familiarizing yourselfs with in the first couple of chapters first before venturing to the end.

If you're lucky some of the concepts, tips, and tricks can be applied outside of the gym in your own lifes.

###Without further adue:

Thank you for reading and please enjoy this early draft of **Hacking Gymnastics** by [Matt Lea](http://shiporgetoffthepot.com?utm_source=hacking_gymnastics).
