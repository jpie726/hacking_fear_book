##Intro:

###Problem:
Have you ever had to battle the fear monster when working with an athelete? Have you ever watched the athelete repeate the same behavior over and over again as if stuck in an painful loop? Ever wish you could break the loop and help them on the path to successfully beating that bad behavior pattern know as fear?

This book contains tips, tricks, phylosphies and stratigies I have developed or adapted from other people to help my athaleates overcome fear issues. 

This book contains a lot of gymnastics references but the lessions can be applied to most any sport or performance based art.

###Who am I:
Your probablly asking what makes you a expert on this topic Matt? If you are not you should be. 

Well I do NOT a dorctorit in neuro-sceintist, and I no kid I have coached has ever gone to the olympics(yet).

No. Oddly enough coaching gymnastics, is not even technically my full time carreer as in I don't do it for the money. Coaching Gymnastics is my passion, and I assume yours if you take the time to read this.

What I do to make money is archetect large scale web applications. Try googling "Matt Lea Wall Street Journal" or "Tech Crunch Disrupt Hackathon Winner 2012 Livebolt".

My occupation as a web application architect is relivant here because through out this book I will use my analytical computer/debugging skills to show you new tricks and tips not widly used in coaching to help you help your atheltes through their fear issues.


//Gives me the opportunity to work with 100s of kids

//Testing learning/etc


###How to use this book:
This book is not meant to be used like an instruction manual or a sceintific report. It is meirly a series of tips and tricks to add to your arsonal. There are some high level concepts I recomend familarizeing yourselfs with in the first couple of chaptors first before venturing to the end.

If your lucky some of the concpets, tips, and tricks can be applied outside of the gym in your own lifes.
